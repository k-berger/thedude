Playground for a simple game based on AmiBlitz for classic AMIGAs.

## AMIGAAAA!
Yeah, the AMIGA is still alive and deserves cool games :-) 
Well, actually, it isn't really _that_ alive but I have a nostalgic itch that I want to scratch by writing this.

## Current State
Nothing to report, really. Ideas were had, mistakes were made.

## Environment
You need an actual AMIGA (AGA) or a good emulator (UAE). 
I worked on this on a Windows machine mostly, but works on Mac (FS-UAE), too.
